`Hashgreen` is a MIT-based startup dedicated to developing on the Chia blockchain. We aspire to solve critical real-world problems using green blockchain technology. As a first step to achieving that goal, we are building dApps and tools on Chia to promote a thriving on-chain economy, and in turn wider adoption. We have launched the first DEX on Chia in January and have many exciting ongoing projects, please join us if you want to change the world together!
